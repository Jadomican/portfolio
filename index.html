        <h1>Summary</h1>

        Jason is currently a student at the Institute of Technology Tallaght. Jason's primary area of study is in Software Development,
        but he has also undergone a wide range of other modules at college and elsewhere.
        <br />
        <br /> Jason is currently in his 4th (and final) year as a full-time Bachelor of Science (Honours) candidate in ITT
        Dublin. During this course Jason has worked on multiple Software Development, Web Design and other Computer Science
        related projects. Jason attended a full-time work placement internship in the sixth semester of his studies at ITT.
        <br />
        <br /> Jason began his IT career in the Summer of 2016, working at
        <a target="_blank" href="http://exertissupplychain.com/">Exertis Supply Chain Services</a> in the role of IT Support.
        Via the work placement option offered in the Institute of Technology Tallaght, Jason also worked at
        <a target="_blank" href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> in the role of Cloud Support Associate (Intern)
        for over 7 months. This experience has allowed Jason to broaden his knowledge of IT to encompass not only Software
        Development, but also Networking, Operating Systems (Windows and Linux), Cloud Computing, Systems Administration
        and more.
